# Sales and Customer Dashboards

This repository contains two interactive Tableau dashboards: **Sales Dashboard** and **Customer Dashboard**. These dashboards provide insights into sales performance and customer behavior, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

### Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard presents an overview of sales metrics and trends to help analyze year-over-year sales performance. It aims to identify sales trends and key insights for sales teams and management.

### Customer Dashboard
The Customer Dashboard provides an overview of customer data, trends, and behaviors. It helps marketing teams and management understand customer segments, improve customer satisfaction, and identify high-value customers.
